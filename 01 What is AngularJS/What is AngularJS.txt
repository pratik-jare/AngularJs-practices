1> What is AngularJS ? 
------>
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that helps build applications that run in a web browser. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2> Who developed AngularJS ?
------>
Google is the company that developed AngularJS. AngularJS is an open source project, which means it can be be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone.

AngularJS is an excellent framework for building both Single Page Applications (SPA) and Line of Business Applications. Many companies are using Angular today, and there are many public facing web sites that are built with angular.

3> What are the benefits of using AngularJS ?
------->
1. Dependency Injection : Dependency Injection is something AngularJS does quite well. If you are new to Dependency Injection, don't worry, we will discuss it in detail with examples in a later video.

2. Two Way Data-Binding : One of the most useful feature in AngularJS is the Two Way Data-Binding. The Two Way Data-Binding, keeps the model and the view in sync at all times, that is a change in the model updates the view and a change in the view updates the model. 

3. Testing : Testing is an area where Angular really shines. Angular is designed with testing in mind right from the start. Angular makes it very easy to test any of it's components through both unit testing and end to end testing. So there's really no excuse for not testing any of your angular application code.

4. Model View Controller : With angular it is very easy to develop applications in a clean MVC way. All you have to do is split your application code into MVC components. The rest, that is managing those components and connecting them together is done by angular.

5. Many more benefits like controlling the behaviour of DOM elements using directives and the flexibility that angular filters provide.

4> To get the script file visit https://angularjs.org. From here 
1. You can download the angular script file 
2. CDN link - We discussed the benefits of using CDN in Part 3 of jQuery tutorial.
3. Various resources to learn angular - Here you will find videos, Free courses, Tutorials and Case Studies. You will also find API reference which is extremeley useful.

5> To get started with angular
1. Add a reference to the angular script
2. Include ng-app attribute 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6> What is ng-app 
In angular, ng-app is called a directive. There are many directives in angular. You can find the complete list of directives on https://angularjs.org. The ng prefix in the directive stands for angular. The ng-app directive is a starting point of AngularJS Application. Angular framework will first check for ng-app directive in an HTML page after the entire page is loaded. If ng-app directive is found, angular bootstraps itself and starts to manage the section of the page that has the ng-app directive. 

So the obvious next question is, where to place the ng-app directive on the page
It should be placed at the root of the HTML document, that is at the [html] tag level or at the [body] tag level, so that angular can control the entire page. 

However, there is nothing stopping you from placing it on any other HTML element with in the page. When you do this only that element and it's children are managed by angular. 

Double curly braces are called binding expressions in angular. These

All the following are valid expressions in angular
{{ 1 == 1 }} - Evaluates to true
{{ { name: 'David', age : '30' }.name }} - Returns the name property value
{{ ['Mark', 'David', 'Sara'][2] }} - Returns the 2nd element from the array

1> Dependency Injection
2> Two Way Data-Binding (change to the model updates the view and change to the view updates the model)
3> testing. (angular is desingned with testing in mind with right from strat, angular has makes it vey easy to test any of its component through both unit testing and end to end testing)
4>ModelViewController (with angular it is very easy to develope applications in clean MVC way all you have to do split ur code in mvc components i.e. the model view controller the REST is managing those components and connecting them together is managed by angular automatically)
5> controlling dom elemets using Directives, flexibility that  Filters  provide etc..
